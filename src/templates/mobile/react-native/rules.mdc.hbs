# React Native Guidelines

## Project Structure
- Organize components by feature or screens
- Separate native modules from shared code
- Use proper folder structure (components, screens, services, utils)
- Keep platform-specific code separate when necessary
- Use consistent naming conventions for files and directories

## Component Architecture
- Use functional components with hooks
- Keep components focused on a single responsibility
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Implement proper prop validation
- Leverage React Native's built-in components appropriately

## State Management
- Use useState and useContext for simple state
- Implement Redux or Zustand for complex state management
- Use React Query or SWR for server state management
- Implement proper state normalization
- Handle async state updates correctly

## Styling
- Use StyleSheet for consistent styling
- Leverage Flexbox for layout management
- Use platform-specific styling when necessary
- Implement responsive design patterns
- Consider using styled-components if preferred

## Platform Differences
- Handle iOS and Android differences appropriately
- Use Platform module for platform-specific code
- Implement proper navigation patterns for each platform
- Consider different UI guidelines for each platform
- Test on both platforms regularly

## Navigation
- Use React Navigation for navigation management
- Implement proper navigation structure
- Use deep linking for better user experience
- Handle navigation state properly
- Implement proper navigation guards if needed

## Performance Optimization
- Implement proper list rendering with FlatList or SectionList
- Use React.memo for component optimization
- Implement proper image optimization
- Use InteractionManager for smooth UI interactions
- Profile and optimize critical rendering paths

## Native Modules
- Use native modules for performance-critical operations
- Implement proper bridging for native functionality
- Handle permissions properly
- Test native modules thoroughly on both platforms
- Document native module usage and requirements

## Testing
- Use Jest for unit testing
- Implement React Native Testing Library for component testing
- Write integration tests for critical user flows
- Test on both iOS and Android simulators/devices
- Use Detox for end-to-end testing

## Networking
- Use fetch or axios for API calls
- Implement proper error handling for network requests
- Use proper caching strategies
- Handle offline scenarios appropriately
- Implement proper request/response logging

## Security
- Store sensitive data securely using appropriate libraries
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Handle permissions appropriately
- Sanitize user inputs properly
- Follow mobile security best practices

## Device Capabilities
- Access device features properly (camera, GPS, etc.)
- Handle device permissions correctly
- Implement proper background task management
- Use appropriate APIs for device-specific features
- Consider battery usage in performance decisions

## Code Sharing
- Maximize code sharing between platforms
- Use platform-specific code only when necessary
- Implement proper abstraction layers
- Use libraries that support cross-platform development
- Maintain consistent behavior across platforms

## Build and Deployment
- Use proper environment configurations
- Implement code signing and certificates
- Use appropriate build tools and processes
- Implement proper release management
- Use services like EAS Build or Fastlane for automation

## Code Style
- Follow React Native style guide
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Keep components and functions concise
- Use proper indentation and formatting
- Write clear, descriptive comments when needed

## Debugging
- Use React Native Debugger or Flipper for debugging
- Implement proper logging strategies
- Use Chrome DevTools for JavaScript debugging
- Leverage React Native's built-in debugging tools
- Implement proper error reporting for production
