# Kubernetes Guidelines

## Cluster Architecture
- Understand master and worker node roles
- Implement proper cluster networking
- Use appropriate cluster sizing
- Follow security best practices
- Plan for high availability

## Pod Design
- Keep pods focused on single responsibilities
- Use appropriate resource requests and limits
- Implement proper health checks (liveness/readiness)
- Follow pod security standards
- Use labels for organization

## Deployments
- Use deployments for stateless applications
- Implement proper rolling updates
- Configure replica sets appropriately
- Use deployment strategies effectively
- Monitor deployment health

## Services
- Use appropriate service types (ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer)
- Implement proper service discovery
- Configure load balancing appropriately
- Use service mesh when needed
- Secure service communication

## ConfigMaps and Secrets
- Use ConfigMaps for configuration data
- Store sensitive data in Secrets
- Implement proper secret management
- Use environment variables appropriately
- Follow security best practices

## Storage
- Choose appropriate storage classes
- Use PersistentVolumes and PersistentVolumeClaims
- Implement proper backup strategies
- Handle stateful applications appropriately
- Configure storage access modes

## Networking
- Implement proper network policies
- Use ingress controllers for external access
- Configure DNS properly
- Handle traffic routing appropriately
- Secure network communication

## Monitoring and Logging
- Implement proper monitoring solutions
- Use Prometheus and Grafana for metrics
- Configure centralized logging
- Set up alerting systems
- Monitor cluster health

## Security
- Follow Pod Security Standards
- Use RBAC for access control
- Implement network policies
- Scan images for vulnerabilities
- Secure cluster components

## Helm Charts
- Use Helm for package management
- Follow chart best practices
- Implement proper templating
- Use values.yaml for configuration
- Version charts appropriately

## Resource Management
- Use namespaces for organization
- Implement resource quotas
- Configure limits and requests
- Use priority classes when needed
- Monitor resource utilization

## CI/CD Integration
- Implement proper deployment pipelines
- Use GitOps for configuration management
- Automate testing and validation
- Follow blue-green or canary deployment strategies
- Implement rollback procedures
