# SolidJS Guidelines

## Project Structure
- Organize components in a logical hierarchy
- Use appropriate folder naming conventions
- Separate components, stores, and utilities
- Follow conventional project organization
- Use consistent file naming patterns

## Component Architecture
- Use JSX for component templates
- Implement proper props handling
- Use children and rendering patterns effectively
- Leverage Solid's component lifecycle
- Follow best practices for component composition

## Reactive Programming
- Use signals (createSignal) for local state
- Implement derived state with createMemo
- Use effects (createEffect, createRenderEffect) appropriately
- Implement computed values efficiently
- Follow reactive patterns best practices

## State Management
- Use contexts for dependency injection
- Implement global state with stores
- Use solid-js/store for complex state management
- Follow state colocation principles
- Implement proper state update patterns

## TypeScript Integration
- Use strict typing throughout the application
- Define proper interfaces for props and state
- Leverage Solid's TypeScript support
- Use type annotations for functions and callbacks
- Implement proper error handling with types

## Performance Optimization
- Leverage fine-grained reactivity
- Use createMemo for expensive computations
- Implement proper component memoization
- Minimize unnecessary re-renders
- Use reconciliation patterns effectively

## Styling
- Use component-scoped styles
- Leverage CSS-in-JS libraries if needed
- Use CSS custom properties for theming
- Implement responsive design patterns
- Follow accessibility best practices

## Routing
- Use solid-app-router or tanstack/router
- Implement proper route definitions
- Use dynamic routing patterns
- Handle route parameters appropriately
- Implement proper navigation patterns

## Effects and Lifecycle
- Use effects appropriately (avoid anti-patterns)
- Implement proper cleanup functions
- Use suspense and resources for async data
- Handle error boundaries effectively
- Follow lifecycle best practices

## Testing
- Use testing libraries appropriate for Solid (e.g., @testing-library/jest-dom)
- Write unit tests for components and logic
- Implement integration tests for complex interactions
- Use Solid's testing utilities effectively
- Follow testing best practices (AAA pattern)

## Forms
- Implement proper form validation patterns
- Use controlled/uncontrolled components appropriately
- Handle form submissions effectively
- Implement proper error messaging
- Use form libraries if needed

## Security
- Sanitize user inputs to prevent XSS
- Use proper CSP headers
- Implement secure authentication patterns
- Validate data on the server side
- Follow Solid security best practices

## Code Style
- Follow Solid's community style guide
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Keep components concise and focused
- Use proper indentation and formatting
- Write clear, descriptive comments when needed

## Build and Deployment
- Use Vite for building Solid projects
- Implement proper environment configurations
- Optimize for production builds
- Use appropriate bundler configurations
- Implement proper CI/CD pipelines
