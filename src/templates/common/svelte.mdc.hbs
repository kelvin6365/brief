# Svelte Guidelines

## Project Structure
- Use the standard Svelte project structure
- Organize components in a logical hierarchy
- Separate components, stores, and utilities
- Use appropriate folder naming conventions
- Follow SvelteKit best practices for routing (if using SvelteKit)

## Component Architecture
- Keep components focused and reusable
- Use props for passing data down the component tree
- Implement proper event dispatching for child-to-parent communication
- Leverage Svelte's reactive declarations ($:, $set, etc.)
- Use slots for flexible component composition

## State Management
- Use stores (writable, readable, derived) for global state
- Implement proper store subscriptions
- Use context API for component-specific data sharing
- Follow Svelte's reactivity patterns
- Consider external state management libraries only when necessary

## TypeScript Integration (if applicable)
- Use strict typing throughout the application
- Define proper interfaces for props and store states
- Leverage Svelte's built-in TypeScript support
- Use type annotations for functions and callbacks
- Implement proper error handling with types

## SvelteKit Specific (if applicable)
- Use file-based routing system effectively
- Implement proper layouts and nested routing
- Use load functions for server-side data fetching
- Implement proper error handling with +error.svelte
- Use hooks for global logic and authentication

## Performance Optimization
- Use keyed each blocks when appropriate
- Implement dynamic imports for code splitting
- Use the {#await} block for promise handling
- Leverage Svelte's compile-time optimizations
- Minimize unnecessary re-renders

## Styling
- Use component-scoped styles by default
- Leverage CSS custom properties for theming
- Use preprocessors like Sass/PostCSS if needed
- Implement responsive design patterns
- Follow accessibility best practices

## Testing
- Use testing libraries appropriate for Svelte (e.g., @testing-library/svelte)
- Write unit tests for components and stores
- Implement integration tests for complex interactions
- Use Svelte's testing utilities effectively
- Follow testing best practices (AAA pattern)

## Forms
- Implement proper form validation patterns
- Use bind:value for two-way data binding
- Handle form submissions appropriately
- Implement proper error messaging
- Use actions for complex form behaviors

## Security
- Sanitize user inputs to prevent XSS
- Use proper CSP headers
- Implement secure authentication patterns
- Validate data on the server side
- Follow Svelte security best practices

## Code Style
- Follow Svelte's official style guide
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Keep components concise and focused
- Use proper indentation and formatting
- Write clear, descriptive comments when needed

## Build and Deployment
- Use Vite for building Svelte projects
- Implement proper environment configurations
- Optimize for production builds
- Use SvelteKit adapter for deployment targets
- Implement proper CI/CD pipelines
