# Svelte Guidelines

## Project Structure
- Organize components in a logical folder structure
- Use SvelteKit's file-based routing (src/routes/)
- Separate components, layouts, and pages appropriately
- Keep related files together (components, styles, tests)
- Use descriptive names for components and folders

## Component Architecture
- Use Svelte's component lifecycle effectively
- Leap properties and reactive declarations properly
- Use reactive assignments with $: for complex reactions
- Implement proper state management patterns
- Keep components focused on a single responsibility

## Svelte 5 Runes (if applicable)
- Use $state for mutable state
- Use $derived for computed values
- Use $effect for side effects
- Use $props for component properties
- Understand the new reactivity model

## SvelteKit Specifics
- Leverage SvelteKit's server-side rendering
- Use load functions for data fetching
- Implement proper error handling with error pages
- Use hooks for global functionality
- Implement proper form handling with actions

## State Management
- Use stores for global state management
- Leverage Svelte's built-in reactivity
- Use derived stores for computed state
- Implement proper cleanup of subscriptions
- Consider context API for component communication

## Styling
- Use component-scoped styles
- Leverage Svelte's style features (global, media queries)
- Use preprocessors (Sass, Less) when needed
- Implement CSS custom properties for theming
- Follow accessibility best practices

## Performance Optimization
- Use runes effectively for performance (Svelte 5)
- Implement code splitting with dynamic imports
- Use Svelte's built-in optimizations
- Implement proper hydration strategies
- Optimize bundle sizes

## TypeScript Integration
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Define interfaces for props and events
- Leverage Svelte's TypeScript support
- Use proper type annotations for stores
- Implement strict typing patterns

## Routing (SvelteKit)
- Use file-based routing system
- Implement dynamic routes with [slug] syntax
- Use +page.svelte for pages, +layout.svelte for layouts
- Implement proper error pages (_error.svelte)
- Use server load functions appropriately

## Forms and Actions (SvelteKit)
- Use SvelteKit's form actions for server-side handling
- Implement proper form validation
- Handle form submissions with progressive enhancement
- Use use:enhance for client-side interactivity
- Implement proper error handling for forms

## Testing
- Use Svelte Testing Library for component testing
- Implement unit tests for utilities and stores
- Write integration tests for complex components
- Use Vite's testing capabilities
- Follow testing best practices

## Accessibility
- Implement proper semantic HTML
- Use ARIA attributes when necessary
- Ensure proper keyboard navigation
- Follow WCAG guidelines
- Use Svelte's accessibility warnings

## Security
- Sanitize user inputs properly
- Implement proper authentication patterns
- Secure API communications
- Follow Svelte/SvelteKit security best practices
- Handle errors gracefully without exposing internals

## Code Style
- Follow Svelte's official style guide
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Keep components concise and readable
- Use proper indentation and formatting
- Write clear, descriptive comments when needed

## Build and Deployment
- Use Vite for bundling and development
- Implement proper environment configurations
- Optimize for production builds
- Use SvelteKit adapters for deployment
- Implement proper CI/CD pipelines
