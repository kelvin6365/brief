# Vue.js Guidelines

## Project Structure
- Organize components in a modular fashion
- Use clear folder structure (components, views, composables, assets, etc.)
- Follow Vue's recommended style guide
- Keep related files together (component, styles, tests)
- Use PascalCase for component names

## Composition API
- Use Composition API with `<script setup>` syntax
- Leverage Vue 3's reactivity system
- Use composables for reusable logic
- Follow proper naming conventions for refs and reactive variables
- Organize composables by functionality

## Component Best Practices
- Keep components focused on a single responsibility
- Use props for data passing from parent to child
- Emit events for child-to-parent communication
- Use slots for flexible content distribution
- Implement proper prop validation

## State Management
- Use Pinia for complex state management
- Keep simple state in components when appropriate
- Use getters for computed derived state
- Implement proper actions for mutations
- Follow predictable state update patterns

## Performance Optimization
- Use v-memo for expensive re-renders (Vue 3.2+)
- Implement proper key attributes for list rendering
- Use dynamic imports for code splitting
- Implement lazy loading for routes
- Use v-show vs v-if appropriately

## TypeScript Integration
- Use proper type annotations for props
- Define interfaces for complex objects
- Use generic types when applicable
- Leverage Vue's type inference
- Implement proper typing for emits

## Styling
- Use scoped styles or CSS modules
- Follow BEM methodology for class naming
- Leverage Vue's CSS variables support
- Use preprocessors (SCSS, PostCSS) when needed
- Implement responsive design patterns

## Testing
- Use Vue Test Utils for component testing
- Implement unit tests for composables
- Write integration tests for complex components
- Use Vue-specific testing utilities
- Follow testing best practices (given-when-then)

## Routing
- Use Vue Router for navigation
- Implement route guards for access control
- Use dynamic routes appropriately
- Implement lazy loading for route components
- Handle route parameters properly

## Accessibility
- Implement proper semantic HTML
- Use ARIA attributes when necessary
- Ensure proper focus management
- Implement keyboard navigation
- Follow WCAG guidelines

## Security
- Sanitize user inputs before rendering
- Use v-html cautiously with proper sanitization
- Implement proper authentication flows
- Secure API communications
- Follow Vue security best practices

## Code Style
- Follow Vue's official style guide
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Keep component files concise and readable
- Use proper indentation and formatting
- Write clear, descriptive comments when needed
