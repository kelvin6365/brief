# JetBrains AI Assistant Core Rules

## Project Context
This project uses {{project.name}} with {{detection.packageManager}} as the package manager. The primary language is {{project.language}}.

## General Guidelines
- Follow the official {{project.language}} style guide and conventions
- Maintain consistency with existing code patterns
- Prioritize readability and maintainability
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Write clear, concise comments only when necessary to explain 'why' not 'what'

## Code Style
- Use consistent indentation ({{#if (eq project.language "javascript")}}2 spaces{{else if (eq project.language "typescript")}}2 spaces{{else if (eq project.language "python")}}4 spaces{{else if (eq project.language "java")}}4 spaces{{else}}your standard{{/if}})
- Follow naming conventions for the language (camelCase, snake_case, PascalCase, etc.)
- Keep lines under 80-100 characters where possible
- Use meaningful prefixes/suffixes for specific types (e.g., `is`, `has`, `can` for booleans)

## Error Handling
- Implement proper error handling strategies
- Use specific error types when available
- Log errors appropriately with context
- Fail gracefully when possible

## Performance Considerations
- Optimize for the {{project.language}} runtime environment
- Avoid unnecessary computations in loops
- Use efficient data structures for the use case
- Consider memory usage in long-running applications

## Testing Approach
- Write unit tests for pure functions
- Use integration tests for complex interactions
- Follow the testing pyramid (more unit tests, fewer integration/end-to-end tests)
- Mock external dependencies appropriately

## Security Practices
- Validate and sanitize all inputs
- Use parameterized queries to prevent injection attacks
- Follow secure coding practices for {{project.language}}
- Protect sensitive data and credentials

## Documentation Standards
- Use appropriate documentation format for the language
- Document public APIs thoroughly
- Update documentation when making changes to public interfaces
- Include examples where helpful
