# Security Guidelines for JetBrains AI Assistant

## Input Validation
- Validate all inputs at the boundaries of the application
- Use allowlists rather than blocklists when possible
- Sanitize inputs to prevent injection attacks
- Encode outputs appropriately to prevent XSS

## Authentication & Authorization
- Implement strong password policies
- Use multi-factor authentication where appropriate
- Apply principle of least privilege
- Implement proper session management
- Use secure authentication protocols (OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect)

## Data Protection
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
- Use industry-standard encryption algorithms
- Implement proper key management
- Mask sensitive data in logs
- Apply data retention policies

## Injection Prevention
- Use parameterized queries/prepared statements
- Implement proper output encoding
- Validate and sanitize file uploads
- Apply content security policies

## Dependency Security
- Keep all dependencies up to date
- Monitor for known vulnerabilities (use tools like Snyk, Dependabot)
- Use only trusted dependencies
- Implement dependency scanning in CI/CD

## API Security
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Use rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Validate and sanitize all API inputs
- Implement proper error handling without exposing internals
- Use HTTPS for all API communications

## Logging & Monitoring
- Log security-relevant events
- Protect log data from unauthorized access
- Monitor for suspicious activities
- Implement alerting for security events
- Don't log sensitive information

## Secure Coding Practices
- Follow the principle of defense in depth
- Fail securely by default
- Implement proper error handling
- Conduct security code reviews
- Perform regular security assessments

## AI-Specific Security Considerations
- Validate AI-generated code for security vulnerabilities
- Be cautious of AI-generated cryptographic implementations
- Review AI-generated configurations for security misconfigurations
- Ensure AI prompts don't leak sensitive information
- Validate AI-generated regex patterns for ReDoS vulnerabilities
