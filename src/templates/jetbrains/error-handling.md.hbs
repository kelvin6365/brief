# Error Handling Patterns for JetBrains AI Assistant

## Error Handling Philosophy
- Handle errors gracefully without crashing the application
- Provide meaningful error messages for debugging
- Fail safely when errors occur
- Log errors appropriately for monitoring and debugging
- Follow consistent error handling patterns throughout the application

## Error Classification
- **System Errors**: Infrastructure or platform-level issues
- **Application Errors**: Issues within the application logic
- **User Errors**: Invalid inputs or requests from users
- **External Errors**: Issues with external services or APIs

## Exception Handling Patterns
- Use specific exception types when available
- Catch exceptions at the appropriate level
- Don't catch exceptions just to log them without handling
- Use finally blocks or try-with-resources for cleanup
- Avoid catching generic exceptions when possible

## Error Recovery Strategies
- Retry mechanisms for transient failures
- Circuit breaker pattern for external dependencies
- Graceful degradation when features fail
- Fallback mechanisms for critical functionality
- Timeouts for operations that might hang

## Logging Best Practices
- Log errors with appropriate context and correlation IDs
- Don't log sensitive information or credentials
- Use structured logging for easier analysis
- Include stack traces for debugging purposes
- Differentiate between expected and unexpected errors

## API Error Handling
- Use appropriate HTTP status codes
- Provide meaningful error responses
- Include error codes for client-side handling
- Don't expose internal implementation details
- Document error responses in API specifications

## Resource Management
- Always release resources in finally blocks
- Use RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) patterns
- Close streams, connections, and other resources properly
- Implement proper cleanup in destructors when applicable
- Use connection pooling appropriately

## Validation and Precondition Checks
- Validate inputs early in function calls
- Use assertions for internal consistency checks
- Fail fast when preconditions are not met
- Provide clear error messages for validation failures
- Use defensive programming techniques

## Error Monitoring and Alerting
- Implement centralized error tracking
- Set up alerts for critical error patterns
- Monitor error rates and trends
- Track error recovery success rates
- Use APM tools for comprehensive error monitoring
