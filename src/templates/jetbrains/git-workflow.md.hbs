# Git Workflow for JetBrains AI Assistant

## Branching Strategy
- Use `main` (or `master`) as the primary stable branch
- Use `develop` as the integration branch for ongoing work
- Create feature branches for new functionality: `feature/description`
- Create hotfix branches for urgent fixes: `hotfix/issue-description`
- Create release branches for preparing releases: `release/version`

## Commit Guidelines
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Use present tense: "Add feature" not "Added feature"
- Limit first line to 50 characters
- Use imperative mood: "Fix bug" not "Fixes bug" or "Fixed bug"
- Include issue numbers if applicable: "Fix #123: Add user authentication"

## Pull Request Process
- Create pull requests for all feature and bug fix branches
- Include a clear description of the changes
- Link to related issues or tickets
- Request reviews from team members
- Ensure all automated checks pass before merging
- Squash commits if necessary to maintain clean history

## Code Review in JetBrains
- Use JetBrains IDE's built-in Git integration for reviewing changes
- Leverage AI Assistant to help analyze code changes during review
- Focus on code quality, functionality, and adherence to standards
- Ensure all feedback is addressed before approving
- Use code review as a learning opportunity

## Git Best Practices
- Commit frequently with logical groupings of changes
- Write meaningful commit messages that explain the 'why'
- Keep commits focused on a single responsibility
- Use `git rebase` to clean up commit history before merging
- Regularly pull from the main branch to stay up-to-date

## Collaboration Guidelines
- Use `.gitignore` to exclude unnecessary files
- Follow the project's branching model consistently
- Communicate branch names and purposes clearly
- Coordinate with team members on shared branches
- Use tags for releases and important milestones

## JetBrains-Specific Git Features
- Use the built-in Git tool window for staging and committing
- Leverage local history for recovery of accidental changes
- Use annotated tags for releases with descriptions
- Take advantage of Git tool windows for conflict resolution
- Use the Log tab to visualize branch history

## Security Considerations
- Never commit credentials, API keys, or secrets
- Use environment variables or configuration files excluded by `.gitignore`
- Scan commits for accidentally included sensitive data
- Review changes carefully before pushing to shared repositories
- Use signed commits if required by the project

## Handling Conflicts
- Address merge conflicts promptly
- Understand the changes before resolving conflicts
- Test functionality after resolving conflicts
- Use JetBrains' merge tool for complex conflicts
- Communicate with team members when conflicts are complex
