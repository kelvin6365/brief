# Core Development Standards

## Project Overview

This is **{{project.name}}**, a {{project.type}} project{{#if project.framework}} built with {{project.framework}}{{/if}}.

{{#if detection.frameworks}}
### Tech Stack
{{#each detection.frameworks}}
- {{name}}{{#if version}} v{{version}}{{/if}}

## Code Style Guidelines

### General Principles

1. **Clarity over cleverness** - Write code that is easy to read and understand
2. **Consistency** - Follow established patterns in the codebase
3. **Simplicity** - Prefer simple solutions over complex ones
4. **DRY** - Don't repeat yourself, but don't over-abstract either

### Naming Conventions

- Use descriptive, meaningful names
- Variables: `camelCase`
- Constants: `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`
- Functions: `camelCase` (verbs: `getUserById`, `calculateTotal`)
- Classes/Types: `PascalCase`
- Files: `kebab-case.ts` or `PascalCase.tsx` for components

### File Organization

- Keep files focused and small (< 300 lines preferred)
- Group related functionality together
- Use index files for clean exports
- Separate concerns: logic, UI, data, utilities

## Error Handling

- Always handle errors gracefully
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Log errors with context for debugging
- Never expose sensitive information in error messages

## Comments and Documentation

- Write self-documenting code first
- Add comments for complex logic or business rules
- Use JSDoc/TSDoc for public APIs
- Keep comments up-to-date with code changes

## Security Considerations

- Never commit secrets or credentials
- Validate all user input
- Use parameterized queries for database operations
- Follow the principle of least privilege

## AI Assistant Guidelines

When assisting with this project:

1. **Follow existing patterns** - Look at similar code in the codebase first
2. **Ask before major changes** - Confirm approach for architectural decisions
3. **Test your suggestions** - Ensure code compiles and passes tests
4. **Be concise** - Provide focused, relevant suggestions
5. **Explain trade-offs** - When there are multiple approaches, explain the pros/cons
