# Angular Guidelines

## Project Structure
- Follow Angular's recommended project structure
- Organize code by feature modules
- Use shared modules for reusable components
- Separate components, services, and models appropriately
- Follow naming conventions consistently

## Component Architecture
- Keep components focused on a single responsibility
- Use OnPush change detection strategy when appropriate
- Implement proper input/output bindings
- Use template reference variables sparingly
- Leverage Angular's built-in directives effectively

## Service and Dependency Injection
- Use services for shared logic and data management
- Implement proper singleton patterns with providedIn: 'root'
- Use providedIn for lazy-loaded modules
- Follow service responsibilities (data, business logic, etc.)
- Implement proper error handling in services

## RxJS and Reactive Programming
- Use Observables for asynchronous operations
- Implement proper subscription management
- Use operators effectively (map, filter, switchMap, etc.)
- Handle errors in observables properly
- Unsubscribe to prevent memory leaks

## TypeScript Integration
- Use strict typing throughout the application
- Implement interfaces for complex objects
- Use enums for fixed sets of values
- Leverage TypeScript generics when appropriate
- Follow Angular's typing patterns

## Routing and Navigation
- Use lazy loading for feature modules
- Implement route guards for access control
- Use route parameters effectively
- Implement proper error handling for navigation
- Use Angular's routerLink directive properly

## State Management
- Use Angular's built-in state management for simple cases
- Consider NgRx for complex state management
- Implement proper selectors for data access
- Use effects for side effects
- Follow unidirectional data flow

## Performance Optimization
- Implement OnPush change detection strategy
- Use trackBy functions for *ngFor directives
- Implement proper lazy loading strategies
- Use Angular's built-in performance tools
- Optimize bundle sizes with tree-shaking

## Styling and Theming
- Use component-scoped styles
- Leverage Angular Material for consistent UI
- Use CSS custom properties for theming
- Follow BEM methodology for class naming
- Implement responsive design patterns

## Testing
- Use Jasmine and Karma for unit testing
- Implement component testing with ComponentFixture
- Write service tests with TestBed
- Use Angular's testing utilities effectively
- Follow testing best practices (AAA pattern)

## Forms
- Use Reactive Forms for complex forms
- Implement proper validation patterns
- Use template-driven forms for simple cases
- Implement custom validators when needed
- Handle form submission properly

## Security
- Sanitize user inputs to prevent XSS
- Use Angular's built-in sanitization
- Implement proper authentication patterns
- Secure API communications
- Follow Angular security best practices

## Code Style
- Follow Angular's style guide
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Keep components and services concise
- Use proper indentation and formatting
- Write clear, descriptive comments when needed

## Build and Deployment
- Use Angular CLI for builds
- Implement proper environment configurations
- Use Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation
- Optimize for production builds
- Implement proper CI/CD pipelines
