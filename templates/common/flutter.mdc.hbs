# Flutter Guidelines

## Project Structure
- Follow Flutter's recommended project structure
- Use lib/ for application code
- Store assets in assets/ directory
- Place tests in test/ directory
- Organize code in logical folders (widgets, models, services, etc.)

## Widget Architecture
- Use StatelessWidget for immutable widgets
- Use StatefulWidget for mutable state
- Implement proper state management patterns
- Follow widget composition principles
- Keep widgets focused and reusable

## State Management
- Choose appropriate state management solution

- Consider Riverpod for advanced use cases
- Use Bloc/Cubit for complex business logic
- Follow unidirectional data flow

## UI/UX Patterns

- Implement responsive design patterns
- Use Flutter's layout widgets effectively
- Apply consistent color schemes and typography
- Implement proper navigation patterns

## Performance
- Optimize widget rebuilds with const constructors
- Use ListView.builder for large lists
- Implement proper image caching and loading
- Minimize unnecessary rebuilds
- Profile and optimize performance bottlenecks

## Testing
- Write comprehensive unit tests
- Implement widget tests for UI components
- Write integration tests for end-to-end flows
- Use golden tests for UI consistency
- Follow testing best practices (AAA pattern)

## Architecture
- Separate business logic from UI
- Use Repository pattern for data access
- Implement proper dependency injection
- Follow clean architecture principles
- Use services for external API communication

## Navigation

- Handle platform-specific features appropriately
- Implement proper error handling for native calls
- Follow platform-specific UI guidelines
- Use plugins when available

## Internationalization
- Implement localization properly
- Use arb files for translations
- Handle RTL languages appropriately
- Implement proper text scaling
- Consider cultural differences

## Code Quality
- Follow Dart and Flutter style guides
- Use meaningful names for classes and functions
- Write clear, concise comments
- Implement proper error handling
- Maintain consistent code formatting

## Build and Release
- Use flavors for different environments
- Implement proper signing configurations
